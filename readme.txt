The NEW WordPress Mobile Pack allows you to 'package' your existing content into a cross-platform mobile web application.

== Description ==

**The WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 has been completely rebuilt from the ground up and repurposed to empower bloggers, publishers and other content creators to go beyond responsiveness and 'appify' the content of their blog.**

WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 is **supported on**: iPhones, Android smartphones, Windows Phone 8. **Compatible browsers**: Safari, Google Chrome, Android - Native Browser and Internet Explorer 10.

The pack has been tested on WordPress 3.5 and later. 

The WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 eliminates the hassle of dealing with high development costs, approval processes with various app stores, poor discoverability due to the closed environment of native apps and finally, one of the biggest injustices aimed towards the publishing industry in general - the shared revenue constraint.

What the WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 enables you to do: 

* **Cross-platform mobile web applications**. All it takes for a mobile web application to run is a modern mobile browser (HTML5 compatible), thus allowing readers to instantly have access to your content, without needing to go through an app store, download & install the app.
 
* **Responsive UI**. The mobile web application is sensitive to various screen sizes and orientation changes: landscape, portrait. In other words, the look and feel of the mobile web app seamlessly morphs into the screen size of users' devices.

* **Theming**. You can offer your users an exceptional reading experience by giving them a mobile web application with a native app-like look & feel. The default theme comes with 6 abstract covers that are randomly displayed on the loading screen to give the app a magazine flavour. 

* **Customize appearance**. Once a favourite theme has been selected, you can customize the colors & fonts, add your logo and graphic elements that can relate to your blog's identity.

* **Posts Sync**. The posts inside the mobile web application are organized into their corresponding categories, thus readers can simply swipe through articles and jump from category to category in a seamless way. 

* **Comments Sync**. All the comments that are displayed in the blog are also synchronized into the mobile web application. On top of that, comments that are posted from within the app are also displayed on the blog.

* **Analytics**. WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 easily integrates with Google Analytics. 

* **Add to Homescreen**. Readers can add the mobile web application to their homescreen and run it in full-screen mode.

= Testing your installation =

Ideally, use a real mobile device to access your (public) site address and check that the switching and mobile web app work correctly.

You can also download a number of mobile emulators that can run on a desktop PC and simulate mobile devices.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What devices and operating systems are supported by my mobile web application? =
WordPress Mobile Pack 2.0 is supported on: iPhones, Android smartphones, Windows Phone 8. Compatible browsers: Safari, Google Chrome, Android - Native Browser and Internet Explorer 10.
Support for other mobile browsers such as Firefox will be added in later releases.

= How can my readers switch back to the desktop theme from my mobile web application? =
The side menu of the mobile web application contains a 'Switch to website' button that will take readers back to the desktop theme. Their option will be remembered the next time they visit your blog.

= How can my readers switch back to the mobile web application from the desktop theme? =
A link called 'Switch to mobile version' will be displayed in the footer of your desktop theme, only for readers that are viewing the site from a supported device and browser. Their option will be remembered the next time they visit your blog.

= I want to temporarily deactivate my mobile web application. What steps must I follow? =
The mobile web application can be deactivated from the "Settings" page of the admin panel. This option will not delete any settings that you have done so far, like customizing the look & feel of your application, but mobile readers will no longer be able to see it on their devices.

= What is the difference between my new mobile web application and a mobile friendly site? = 
The short answer is that a mobile web application is an enriched version of a mobile-friendly site; it's not only about screen size, it's also about functionality (offline mode, for example). The long answer comes in a form of an article, you can check it out here: http://www.appticles.com/blog/2014/05/mobile-web-dying-shifting/.

= What is the difference between my mobile web application and a responsive theme? =  
A responsive theme is all about design - it loads the same styling as the desktop view, adjusting it to fit a smaller screen. A mobile web application combines the versatility of the web with the functionality of touch-enabled devices and can contain features that your desktop website doesn't have (like offline mode for example). A mobile web app is similar to a native app in terms of look & feel, with the only difference being that it runs in the browser.

= Am I able to use my own theme or customize the existing one? =  
V2.0 is based on a Javascript framework called Sencha Touch, that mimics a native app interface. Because of that, the themes used are not regular PHP based themes that can be easily customized by editing the source. It is still possible to make small CSS changes, but changing the theme structure will not work.

= Am I able to add Javascript code inside the theme? =
Adding tracking scripts in the source is possible if you place them in the <head> section of the theme files. However, code that is placed inside the posts will not be executed. The theme is implemented enterily in Javascript and that would mean Javascript code inside another Javascript code.

= Am I able to integrate my own advertisement? =
Support for various ad networks will be added in future releases. These will be managed enterily from the admin panel, so you won't have to modify the source to integrate ads.
